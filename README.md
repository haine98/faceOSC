# faceOSC

IMPORTANT SIDENOTE: Recently, my hard drive unexpectedly
broke, so this is not the full code. After retrieving back
the info from my hard drive, I will upload it back on here.
However, the most important file was thankfully saved and 
is added here on this github repository.

FaceOSC simplifies the tracked face into two eyes that shoot
ice spheres and turn red when opened wide. It follows the user
and also tracks their blinks.
